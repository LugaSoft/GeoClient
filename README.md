# GeoClient

This example uses OpenLayers to display a single geographic position on a map. It serves as a basic demonstration of how position data—such as that generated by the GeoClient iOS app—can be received and visualized in a browser environment. The position is loaded from a plain text file and represents a simplified prototype, not a live connection.
